# LearningGit

### First error: While push to the branch
ERROR: "fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch"
SOLUTION: "git push --set-upstream origin Niraj"


ERROR : git pull remote branch cannot find remote ref
SOLUTION : git pull -u origin main 



### GIT MERGE TYPES---------------------
git merge (fast forward) (Remove the branch history)
git merge --no--ff (Brancing history remains) (Best way)

git rebase
git rebase --squash


git log --graph --all (For graph preview in terminal) (--online flag do what?)


### UNDOING uncommited files
git checkout --  OR git checkout -- . (FOr all files that has changes)


### BRANCH
git branch (list all branch)
git branch givename (Create new branch)
git checkout givename (Switch branch)
git merge branchname (First get into master branch then create ma merge request) (:wq - write and quite)
git checkout -b branchname (This will create new branch and switch into new branch)
git branch -d branchname (To delete the branch)


### UNDO commited changes
git revert #commitID   (This will revert and commit the changes) (:q for quiting)
git revent -n #commitID (It will not commit the changes you must explicitly commit the file afterward)
git reset #commithash --hard (For revert back to the commit history) (Distructive approach)

### What is pull request?


git difftool #commit1 #commit2

.gitignore file

pulling before pushing
